# Sprint 12 - Module 2 Project: Gold Recovery from Gold Ore - Zyfra

## Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict gold recovery in a processing plant. We use real production data, including physical and chemical parameters measured at different stages of the process.

---

## Datasets

- `gold_recovery_train.csv`: training set.
- `gold_recovery_test.csv`: test set (without targets).
- `gold_recovery_full.csv`: complete set with all features.

> The data is indexed by date and time (`date`). Parameters close in time are usually similar.
